IMPORTANT: Database Migration Commands

After implementing the payment system, you need to run these commands to update your database:

1. Create migration for the new Payment model:
   python manage.py makemigrations core

2. Apply the migration to your database:
   python manage.py migrate

3. (Optional) Create a superuser if you haven't already:
   python manage.py createsuperuser

4. (Optional) Collect static files if in production:
   python manage.py collectstatic

NOTES:
- The Payment model has been added to core/models.py
- This will create a new table to track payment transactions
- All existing orders will continue to work normally
- The new payment system is backward compatible

TESTING:
- Use the sandbox credentials provided in payment_settings.py
- Test with PayMaya test cards before going live
- Verify webhook functionality works correctly
